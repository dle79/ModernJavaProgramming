The return value from compareTo is 0 if the name of both employee is equal.
This is not always true. 
Set<Employee> employeeSet = new HashSet<>();
		employeeSet.add(new Employee("Tim", 50000));
		employeeSet.add(new Employee("Tim", 50000));
System.out.println(employeeSet); // Prints [<name: Tim salary: 50000>,<name: Tim salary: 50000>]

As per contract there cannot be two Employee with name "Tim" in the Set. 
But above example shows that two employee objects are not same
even if they have same name.
