In this solution, the method inList() uses Employee's equals(Employee e) method for comparison. 
Although the solution generates correct result at this point, the equals method is supposed to
be overridden version of Object class:
 @Override
public boolean equals(Object e)
	
This solution doesn't work in the method listsAreEqual, where List<Employee>().contains(Object) method 
is used to identify whether an employee is in a list. This is because, the contains method uses the
Object's equals (Object) method, not the Employee's equals(Employee) method. Again, overriding
equals(Object) method solves this problem.
